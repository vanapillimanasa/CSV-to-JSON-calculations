**Stepwise Instructions**
    Certainly, here's a step-by-step guide on how to run and understand the provided Python code. I'll break it down into clear steps:

**Step 1: Prerequisites**
    Before you start, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
    Python 3.x: You can download Python from the official website: 
        https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Step 2: Prepare Input Data**
    Create an input CSV file named ‘input.csv’. You can use a text editor or spreadsheet software to create this file.
    Example ‘input.csv’ content:
      Name,Number
      John,153
      Alice,28
      Bob,6
    You can add more records to this file if needed.

**Step 3: Understand the Code**
Now, let's understand the code before running it.
•	The code is organized into several sections:
    • Importing necessary libraries.
    •	Defining JSON schemas for input and output data.
    •	Defining functions to check for Armstrong, Strong, and Perfect numbers (actual implementations are not provided).
    •	Reading and parsing data from input.csv.
    •	Processing the data and creating output data.
    •	Writing the output data to output.json.
    •	Validating both input and output data against JSON schemas.
•	The code processes the input data and checks if each number is an Armstrong number, a Strong number, and a Perfect number based on the provided functions.

**Step 4: Create a requirements.txt File (Optional)**
If you haven't already, you can create a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies. Include the following content:
    **jsonschema==3.2.0
      pyyaml==5.4.1**
You can create this file using a text editor.

**Step 5: Install Dependencies (Optional)**
If you created a ‘requirements.txt’ file, you can install the required dependencies using ‘pip’. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    **pip install -r requirements.txt**
This will install the necessary library for JSON schema validation.

**Step 6: Run the Code**
Save the provided code in a Python file, e.g., ‘main.py’.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your ‘main.py’ file is located using the cd command.
Run the code using the following command:
    **python main.py**

**Step 7: View Output**
After running the code, it will process the input data, generate an output JSON file named ‘output.json’, and perform validation against JSON schemas.
You can view the processed output by opening the ‘output.json’ file using a text editor or by running the following command in your terminal:
   **cat output.json  # On Linux/macOS
    type output.json  # On Windows**
This will display the content of the ‘output.json file’, which will contain the processed data in JSON format.

**Step 8: Understand Validation**
The code also performs validation against JSON schemas for both input and output data. It will print whether the data is valid or not based on the specified schemas. If there are any validation errors, the code will provide informative error messages.
That's it! You've successfully executed the code, processed input data, generated output, and performed validation against JSON schemas. You can modify the input data in the ‘input.csv’ file and run the code again to process different data.
